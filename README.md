## About Rizzme

rizzme was a proposal prototype for a competition about enhancing education in egypt, we took the approach of empowring offline trainers and tutors with tools to manage and monitor their students, courses, materials,etc ...

## the project

unfortunatly we were not successful at the competition, and the business needs changed a bit by facebook pushing forward new solutions for education therefore we stopped this project
